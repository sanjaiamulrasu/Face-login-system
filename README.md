Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH)

LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) is a traditional face recognition algorithm that identifies individuals based on local texture patterns of facial images. Unlike deep learning models, LBPH does not require large datasets or high computational resources, making it suitable for real-time and small-scale applications.
